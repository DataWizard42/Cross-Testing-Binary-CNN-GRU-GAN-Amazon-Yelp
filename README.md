Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the code and its components, which you can use to explain the process on your GitHub README.md page:

# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning models to perform sentiment analysis on review datasets from Amazon and Yelp.

## Installation

To run the scripts, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install contractions textsearch tqdm nltk tensorflow pandas numpy beautifulsoup4
```

Additionally, you need to download the NLTK 'punkt' tokenizer:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

- Stripping HTML tags from the reviews.
- Removing accented characters.
- Expanding contractions (e.g., "isn't" to "is not").
- Lowercasing the text.
- Removing non-alphanumeric characters.
- Tokenizing and padding sequences to a uniform length.

## Model Architecture

Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are used for binary classification of the reviews:

- `modelAmazon`: Trained on the Amazon review dataset.
- `modelYelp`: Trained on the Yelp review dataset.

Both models are saved and can be loaded for evaluation:

```python
modelAmazon = keras.models.load_model('path_to_amazon_model.h5')
modelYelp = keras.models.load_model('path_to_yelp_model.h5')
```

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are:

- Amazon review dataset for training and testing.
- Yelp review dataset for testing.
- Manually inputted reviews for additional testing.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated on both datasets to check their performance:

- The Amazon model is tested on the Yelp dataset and vice versa.
- Accuracy metrics are printed to assess the models.

## Usage

To use the models for prediction, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the review text.
2. Convert the text to sequences using the tokenizer.
3. Pad the sequences to the maximum length.
4. Use the model's `evaluate` method to get the accuracy.

## Example Output

```bash
Testing Amazon Classifier on Yelp Test Data
Accuracy: 86.00%

Testing Yelp Classifier on Amazon Test Data
Accuracy: 90.00%
```

This README provides an overview of the project structure and instructions for setting up and evaluating the models. For detailed usage and more in-depth explanation, refer to the individual scripts and Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.
